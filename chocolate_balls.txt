Ingredients:
- 100 g	(1/2) cup) caster (superfine) sugar
- 100 g	(3 1/2 oz) unsalted butter (1 tbsp short of half a cup)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
- 3 tablespoon strong coffee, hot
- 3 tablespoon cocoa powder
- A pinch of flaked sea salt
- 125 g	(1 1/2 cups) rolled oats
- 50 g	(1 1/2 oz) desiccated coconut

Directions:
1. Mix together the butter, sugar and vanilla until fully combined.
2. In a small bowl combine the coffee and cocoa powder and mix to form a thick paste. Allow to cool slightly then pour into the butter mixture and mix together until fully combined. Add the salt and oats and mix together until fully combined.
3. Take a spoonful of the mixture and roll between your hands to form a small ball. Roll in the coconut and set aside and repeat with the remaining mixture. Refrigerate until firm. Best served slightly chilled although perfectly good at room temperature too.
